"aboutAnswer":"Wisden Cricketers\' Almanack (or simply Wisden or colloquially \"The Bible of Cricket\") is a cricket reference book published annually in the United Kingdom. The description \"Bible of Cricket\" was first used in the 1930s by Alec Waugh in a review for the London Mercury.\nIn October 2013, an all-time Test World XI was announced to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers\' Almanack.\nWisden was founded in 1864 by the English cricketer John Wisden (1826â€“84) as a competitor to Fred Lillywhite\'s The Guide to Cricketers. Its annual publication has continued uninterrupted to the present day, making it the longest running sports annual in history."
