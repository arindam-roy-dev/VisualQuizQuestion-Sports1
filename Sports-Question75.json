He has won 29 trophies in his career, including six league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, one UEFA European Championship, and one UEFA Nations League.\nA prolific goalscorer, Ronaldo holds the records for most goals scored in the UEFA Champions League (126) and the UEFA European Championship (9), as well as those for most assists in the Champions League (44) and the European Championship (6). He has scored over 700 senior career goals for club and country.\nBorn and raised on the Portuguese island of Madeira, Ronaldo was diagnosed with a racing heart at age 15. He underwent an operation to treat his condition, and began his senior club career playing for Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United at age 18 in 2003. After winning his first trophy in England, the FA Cup, during his first season there, he helped United win three successive Premier League titles, a UEFA Champions League title, and a FIFA Club World Cup.\nBy age 22, he had received Ballon d\'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year nominations and at age 23, he won his first Ballon d\'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year awards.
