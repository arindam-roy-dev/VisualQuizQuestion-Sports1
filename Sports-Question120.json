"aboutAnswer":"Lacrosse is a team sport played with a lacrosse stick and a lacrosse ball.\nIt is the oldest organized sport in North America, with its origins in indigenous Canada as early as the 17th century.\nThe game was extensively modified by European colonists, reducing the violence, to create its current collegiate and professional form.\nPlayers use the head of the lacrosse stick to carry, pass, catch, and shoot the ball into the goal.\nThe sport has four versions that have different sticks, fields, rules and equipment: field lacrosse, women\'s lacrosse, box lacrosse and intercrosse. The men\'s games, field lacrosse (outdoor) and box lacrosse (indoor), are contact sports and all players wear protective gear: helmet, gloves, shoulder pads, and elbow pads.\nThe women\'s game is played outdoors and does not allow body contact but does allow stick to stick contact.\nThe only protective gear required for women players is eyegear, while goalies wear helmets and protective pads.\nIntercrosse is a mixed-gender non-contact sport played indoors that uses an all-plastic stick and a softer ball.\nThe modern sport is governed by World Lacrosse and is the only international sport organization to recognize First Nations bands and Native American tribes as sovereign nations.\nThe organization hosts the World Lacrosse Championship for men, the Women\'s Lacrosse World Cup, the World Indoor Lacrosse Championship for box lacrosse, and the Under-19 World Lacrosse Championships for both men and women. Each is held every four years.\nLacrosse at the Summer Olympics has been contested at two editions of the Summer Olympic Games, 1904 and 1908. It was also held as a demonstration event at the 1928, 1932, and 1948 Summer Olympics."
