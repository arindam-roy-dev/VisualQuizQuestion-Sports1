"aboutAnswer":"Association football is governed internationally by the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA), which organises World Cups for both men and women every four years.\nFIFA is responsible for the organization of football\'s major international tournaments, notably the World Cup which commenced in 1930 and the Women's World Cup which commenced in 1991.\nFIFA was founded in 1904 to oversee international competition among the national associations of Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. Headquartered in Zürich, its membership now comprises 211 national associations. Member countries must each also be members of one of the six regional confederations into which the world is divided: Africa, Asia, Europe, North & Central America and the Caribbean, Oceania, and South America.\nAlthough FIFA does not control the rules of football, that being the responsibility of the International Football Association Board, it is responsible for both the organization of a number of tournaments and their promotion, which generate revenue from sponsorship. In 2017, FIFA had revenues of over US $734 million, for a net loss of $189 million, and had cash reserves of over US$930 million."
