"aboutAnswer":"Formula One (also known as Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class of international racing for single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l\'Automobile (FIA).\nThe World Drivers\' Championship, which became the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981, has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950.\nThe word formula in the name refers to the set of rules to which all participants\' cars must conform. A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, which take place worldwide on both purpose-built circuits and closed public roads.\nA points system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World Championships: one for drivers, the other for constructors. Each driver must hold a valid Super Licence, the highest class of racing licence issued by the FIA.\nThe races must run on tracks graded \"1\" (formerly \"A\"), the highest grade-rating issued by the FIA.\nFormula One cars are the fastest regulated road-course racing cars in the world, owing to very high cornering speeds achieved through the generation of large amounts of aerodynamic downforce.\nThe cars underwent major changes in 2017, allowing wider front and rear wings, and wider tyres, resulting in peak cornering forces near 6.5 lateral g and top speeds of around 350 km/h (215 mph).\nAs of 2021, the hybrid engines are limited in performance to a maximum of 15,000 rpm; the cars are very dependent on electronics and aerodynamics, suspension and tyres.\nTraction control, launch control, and automatic shifting, plus other electronic driving aids, were first banned in 1994, reintroduced in 2001, and have more recently been banned since 2004 and 2008, respectively."
