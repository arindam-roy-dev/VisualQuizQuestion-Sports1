"aboutAnswer":"Volleyball is a popular team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team\'s court under organized rules.\nThe complete rules are extensive, but simply, play proceeds as follows - A player on one of the teams begins a \'rally\' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm), from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into the receiving team\'s court.\The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court. The team may touch the ball up to 3 times, but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively."
