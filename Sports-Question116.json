"aboutAnswer":"The 1930 FIFA World Cup was the inaugural FIFA World Cup, the world championship for men\'s national football teams. It took place in Uruguay from 13 to 30 July 1930.\nFIFA, football\'s international governing body, selected Uruguay as host nation, as the country would be celebrating the centenary of its first constitution and the Uruguay national football team had successfully retained their football title at the 1928 Summer Olympics.\nAll matches were played in the Uruguayan capital, Montevideo, the majority at the Estadio Centenario, which was built for the tournament.\nThirteen teams (seven from South America, four from Europe and two from North America) entered the tournament. Only a few European teams chose to participate because of the difficulty of travelling to South America during the Great Depression.\nThe teams were divided into four groups, with the winner of each group progressing to the semi-finals. The first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously and were won by France and the United States, who defeated Mexico 4–1 and Belgium 3–0, respectively.\nLucien Laurent of France scored the first goal in World Cup history, while that day United States goalkeeper Jimmy Douglas posted the first \"clean sheet\" in the tournament.\nArgentina, Uruguay, the United States and Yugoslavia each won their respective groups to qualify for the semi-finals. In the final, hosts and pre-tournament favourites Uruguay defeated Argentina 4–2 in front of a crowd of 68,346 people to become the first nation to win the World Cup."
