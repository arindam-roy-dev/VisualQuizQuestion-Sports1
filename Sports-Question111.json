"aboutAnswer":"The Olympic symbols are icons, flags, and symbols used by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to elevate the Olympic Games.\nThe rings are five interlocking rings, coloured blue, yellow, black, green and red on a white field, known as the \"Olympic rings\". The symbol was originally created in 1913 by Coubertin. He appears to have intended the rings to represent the five continents: Europe, Asia, Africa, The Americas, and Oceania. According to Coubertin, the colours of the rings together with the white of the background included the colours composing every competing nation\'s flag at the time.\nIt was first hoisted in 1920 in Antwerp, Belgium at the 1920 Summer Olympics in the main stadium. The five rings represent the five continents of the world."
