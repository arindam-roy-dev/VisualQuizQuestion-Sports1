"aboutAnswer":"Ski Jumping is a winter sport in which competitors aim to achieve the longest jump after descending from a specially designed ramp on their skis. Along with jump length, competitor\'s style and other factors affect the final score.\nSki Jumping was first contested in Norway in the late 19th century, and later spread through Europe and North America in the early 20th century. Along with cross-country skiing, it constitutes the traditional group of Nordic skiing disciplines.\nThe ski jumping venue, commonly referred to as a hill, consists of the jumping ramp (in-run), take-off table, and a landing hill. Each jump is evaluated according to the distance traveled and the style performed. The distance score is related to the construction point (also known as the K-point), which is a line drawn in the landing area and serves as a \"target\" for the competitors to reach.\nThe score of each judge evaluating the style can reach a maximum of 20 points. The jumping technique has evolved over the years, from jumps with the parallel skis with both arms pointing forwards, to the \"V-style\", which is widely used today.\nSki jumping has been included at the Winter Olympics since 1924 and at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships since 1925. Women\'s participation in the sport began in the 1990s, while the first women\'s event at the Olympics has been held in 2014. All major ski jumping competitions are organised by the International Ski Federation. Stefan Kraft holds the official record for the world\'s longest ski jump with 253.5 metres (832 ft), set on the ski flying hill in Vikersund in 2017."
