"aboutAnswer":"Deshabandu Muttiah Muralitharan (born 17 April 1972), is a former Sri Lankan cricketer who was rated the greatest Test match bowler ever by Wisden Cricketers\' Almanack in 2002. He retired from Test cricket in 2010, registering his 800th and final wicket on 22 July 2010 from his final ball in his last Test match.\nMuralitharan holds the world record for the most wickets in both test and one-day cricket. In 2017, he became the only Sri Lankan to be inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame. He won the Ada Derana Sri Lankan of the Year in 2017.\nAt the start of his last match, Muralitharan was eight short of 800 wickets. At the fall of the ninth wicket of the Indian\'s second innings Muralitharan still needed one wicket to reach the milestone. After 90 minutes of resistance Muralitharan was able to dismiss the last Indian batsman Pragyan Ojha on the last delivery of the final over of his Test career. By doing so he became the only bowler to reach 800 wickets in Test cricket. Sri Lanka won the match by 10 wickets, the seventh time they have done so and the second time they have done it against India."
