"aboutAnswer":"In tennis, in a legal service, the ball travels over the net (without touching it) and into the diagonally opposite service box. If the ball hits the net but lands in the service box, this is a let or net service, which is void, and the server retakes that serve.\nThe player can serve any number of let services in a point and they are always treated as voids and not as faults.\nA fault is a serve that falls long or wide of the service box, or does not clear the net.\nThere is also a \"foot fault\", which occurs when a player\'s foot touches the baseline or an extension of the center mark before the ball is hit. If the second service is also a fault, the server double faults, and the receiver wins the point. However, if the serve is in, it is considered a legal service."
