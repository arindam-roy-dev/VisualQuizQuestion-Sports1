"aboutAnswer":"Wimbledon is the oldest tennis tournament in the world, and is regarded by many as the most prestigious. It has been held at the All England Club in Wimbledon, London, since 1877 and is played on outdoor grass courts.\nWimbledon is one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments, the others being the Australian Open, the French Open and the US Open. Since the Australian Open shifted to hardcourt in 1988, Wimbledon is the only major still played on grass.\nThe tournament traditionally took place over two weeks in late June and early July, starting on the last Monday in June and culminating with the Ladies\' and Gentlemen\'s Singles Finals."
